4. How you position yourself in this industry after 2 years.
Answer: In two years, I aim to be a highly skilled professional, specializing in areas like machine learning or data science. I plan to have a proven track record of delivering successful projects, actively contribute to the open-source community, and take on leadership roles within my team. My focus on continuous learning and adaptability will ensure my skills remain cutting-edge, and building a strong professional network will contribute to my growth within the industry.

5. List 3 projects / products you have built or have planned to build in the upcoming year, also explain your role in the same.
Answer: World Coin Currency Detection:
For this personal project, I developed a deep learning model using CNN, Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. The aim was to predict the face value of coins and currencies, along with identifying the country of origin. I achieved an impressive 86% accuracy on the test data by applying image augmentation techniques. The project successfully classified currencies from 32 different countries across 211 distinct classes. The practical application of this project lies in improving vending machine functionality.

Music Genre Classification:
As a solo developer, I crafted a machine learning model for automatic music genre classification. Utilizing KNN, Python, Tkinter, Pygame, and NumPy, I created a user-friendly interface to interact with the trained model. The project efficiently processed and analyzed audio files, contributing to enhanced music recommendation systems.

Face Attendance System:
In another personal endeavor, I delved into computer vision using Python, OpenCV, face-recognition, and Pandas. The result was a robust face recognition system for real-time detection of faces, automating attendance marking with accurate date and time records. This project, with its cutting-edge computer vision techniques, streamlined attendance processes in both educational and industrial settings.
